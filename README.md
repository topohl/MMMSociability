# MMMSociability

R code for analyzing sociability data.

Maintained by [Tobias Pohl (topohl)](https://github.com/topohl) [1, 3]. Based at the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC), affiliated with the Hörnberg Lab [3].

## Description

This repository contains R scripts and functions designed for the analysis of sociability data [1]. The code likely supports research on stress and automated behavior analysis, potentially using data from systems like PhenoSys MMM (Multi-Modal Monitoring), given the owner's focus and related repositories like `MMManalyzer` [3].

## Contents

The repository is structured into the following main directories [1]:

*   `/Functions`: Houses reusable R functions developed for the analysis pipeline [1].
*   `/Analysis`: Contains the primary R scripts that implement the sociability analysis workflow [1].

## Language

*   The code is written entirely in R [1].

## Installation & Usage

*(Details on how to install necessary dependencies (e.g., R packages) and run the analysis scripts should be added here. This might include setup instructions and example commands.)*

## License

*(A license file (e.g., MIT, GPL, Apache 2.0) should be included in the repository to specify how others can use, modify, and distribute this code.)* [2]

## Citation

*(If you use this code or analysis approach in your research, please consider citing this repository. The owner may consider creating a persistent identifier like a DOI via services such as Zenodo to facilitate academic citation.)* [2]
